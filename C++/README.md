# C++
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It is used to create executables and dynamic libraries. statically typed, compiled programming language that is designed to have a small memory footprint and high performance. It is multi-paradigm and has a strong focus on system programming. 
## Features
- compiled 
- multi-paradigm 
- statically typed 
- general-purpose 
- high-performance 
- small memory footprint 
- multi-threaded 
- dynamic 
- feature-rich 
- portable
  
## Limitations
- Steep learning curve
- Static typing
- Not as portable as C
- Not as fast as C
- Not as flexible as C
- Too many features
- GUI is harder to create
- Higher level than C
- Not as easy to learn compared to high-level languages
- Very limited in libraries

## Why C++?
If you are a C programmer than C++ provides a lot of features that you can use in your code. If you're a programmer of higher level languages than C++ than C++ provides a faster and more flexible language that is closer to the hardwere.

## Compiler
C++ compiler is called a C++ compiler. It is a compiler that takes C++ code and compiles it into a binary.
The most common C++ compiler is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). Other compilers are Clang and MSVC. Clang is a much faster compiler than GCC and MSVC. It also supports other languages such as C, C++ and Objective-C. Both gcc and are compatible with each other. They both use the GNU toolchain for linking.
### Compilation
To compile C++ code you need to use the C++ compiler.

```bash
g++ -o program.exe program.cpp
```
for clang
```bash
clang++ -o program.exe program.cpp
```
for MSVC
```bash
cl /c program.cpp
```
### Linking
Linking is the process of combining the object files into a binary. The most common linker is the GNU
