print("Hello World") 
# Print function is used to display the output on the console.
# A Function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
# You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
# A function can return data as a result. However, it does not have to.
# A function can return more than one value. This is called a tuple. This is discussed in the ADT section.

# We may write our own functions as follows:
def sumOfTwoNumbers(a, b): 
    # a and b are parameters
    # def is a keyword used to define a function ie. it is written before the name of the function
    # sumOfTwoNumbers is the name of the function
    # (a, b) is the parameter list
    return a + b # return is used to return a value from a function
