# Python
Python is a programming language that is interpreted and compiled. It is designed to be highly readable and easy to use.
### Installation
Python is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
You may install Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
### Syntax
Python is a programming language that is interpreted and compiled. It is designed to be highly readable and easy to use.
### Key Terms
#### Interpreter
An interpreter is a program that executes other programs. Python is an interpreted Language meaning that it is not require to be compiled before it can be executed. 
when you run the following command in the terminal:
```
python hello.py
```
The interpreter will execute the hello.py file. The "python" is the interpreter and "hello.py" is the file that is being executed. The python virtual machine (PVM) is a virtual machine that runs python code ie. the python interpreter.
#### Compiler
A compiler is a program that translates a program written in one programming language into a program written in another programming language. In Python, the compiler is the python virtual machine.
#### Virtual Machine
A virtual machine is a program that runs other programs. In Python, the virtual machine is the python interpreter.
#### Interpreter vs Compiler
The python interpreter is a program that executes other programs. The python compiler is a program that translates a program written in one programming language into a program written in another programming language.
#### Module
A module is a file that contains a set of functions that can be used by other programs. Python has many built-in modules that are highly useful. For example, the math module contains functions that can be used to perform mathematical operations. For an additional list of built-in modules, see the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).
#### Package
A package is a collection of modules. A package is a directory that contains a set of modules. For example, one of the most commonly used packages is the [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) module.
